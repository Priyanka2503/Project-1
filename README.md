# Optimizing a ML Pipeline in Azure
## Overview
#### This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.
## Summary
#### In this project, you'll have the opportunity to create and optimize an ML pipeline. You'll be provided a custom-coded model—a standard Scikit-learn Logistic Regression—the hyperparameters of which you will optimize using HyperDrive. You'll also use AutoML to build and optimize a model on the same dataset, so that you can compare the results of the two methods.
#### The main steps are shown in diagram below:
